# Predicting_output_of_CCPP

In this project that I did at the Tata Power.

I developed a model using Artificial Neural Network using Python, to predict the power output of the CCPP Unit-7 using the real time data.

In here I first pre-processed data to get the relavent data after that i did scaling of the dataset. 

The model created gave excellent predictions with excellent MSE of 16.28. 

For confidentiality reasons I dont have the real dataset so I am using similar dataset from UCI.

A huge thanks to Engineers at Tata Power for allwoing me to do the project and guide me through it.
